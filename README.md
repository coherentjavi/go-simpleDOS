# Go-SpoofIP

The code here was solely created for educational purposes so others can better understand how a simple DOS IP spoof attack could be implemented. As it's educational, it's meant to only be carried out within your local network on devices you own (if on any).

Please note that in practice an attack as the one here won't work due to many factors. Including being as specified, NAT (Network address translation), firewalls and others.
